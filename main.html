					<div class="par one">
						<p class="right">Robin McLaurin Williams was born at St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago, Illinois,
							on
							July 21, 1951.
							He had English, French, German, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh ancestry. Williams attended
							public
							elementary school in Lake Forest at Gorton Elementary School and middle school
							at Deer Path Junior High School. He described himself as a quiet child who did not overcome
							his
							shyness until he became involved with his high school drama department.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="par two">
						<p class="left">As both his parents worked, Williams was partially raised by the family's maid,
							who was his main companion. When he was 16, his father took early retirement and the family
							moved to Tiburon,
							California. Following their move, Williams attended Redwood High School in nearby Larkspur.
							At the time of his graduation in 1969, he was voted "Most Likely Not to Succeed" and
							"Funniest"
							by his classmates.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="par three">
						<p class="right">Williams attained a full scholarship to the Juilliard School (Group 6,
							1973–1976)
							in New York City.
							He was one of 20 students accepted into the freshman class, and he and Christopher Reeve
							were
							the only two accepted
							by John Houseman into the Advanced Program at the school that year.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="par four">
						<p class="left">Williams began performing stand-up comedy in the San Francisco Bay Area.
							He gave his first performance at the Holy City Zoo, a comedy club in San Francisco, where he
							worked his way up from tending bar.
							Williams moved to Los Angeles and continued performing stand-up at clubs including The
							Comedy
							Store.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="par five">
						<p class="right">His first major break came from his starring role in director Barry Levinson's
							Good
							Morning, Vietnam,
							which earned Williams a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="par six">
						<p class="left">On August 11, 2014, at his home in Paradise Cay, California, Williams committed
							suicide by hanging.
							His body was cremated at Monte's Chapel of the Hills in San Anselmo, and his ashes were
							scattered over San Francisco Bay the next day.</p>

						<li>“There is still a lot to learn and there is always great stuff out there. Even mistakes can
							be
							wonderful.”</li>
						<li>“I try to make sense of things. Which is why, I guess, I believe in destiny. There must be a
							reason
							that I am as I am. There must be.”</li>
						<li>“I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone. It’s not. The worst thing
							in
							life
							is to end up with people that make you feel all alone.”</li>
						<li>“I think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy. Because they know
							what
							it’s like to feel absolutely worthless and they don’t want anybody else to feel like that.”
						</li>
						<li>“You will have bad times, but they will always wake you up to the stuff you weren’t paying

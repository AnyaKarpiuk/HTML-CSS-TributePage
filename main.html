			<h1>- Quotes -</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>“There is still a lot to learn and there is always great stuff out there. Even mistakes can be
					wonderful.”</li>
				<li>“I try to make sense of things. Which is why, I guess, I believe in destiny. There must be a reason
					that I am as I am. There must be.”</li>
				<li>“I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone. It’s not. The worst thing in life
					is to end up with people that make you feel all alone.”</li>
				<li>“I think the saddest people always try their hardest to make people happy. Because they know what
					it’s like to feel absolutely worthless and they don’t want anybody else to feel like that.”</li>
				<li>“You will have bad times, but they will always wake you up to the stuff you weren’t paying attention
					to.”</li>
				<li>“Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Be kind. Always.”</li>
